### React Simple Reducer

A heavily [redux-toolkit](https://redux-starter-kit.js.org/) inspired helper to use react's `useReducer`.
Different from redux-toolkit, this is meant to be used to manage the state of a page of a group of components. It can be used with components being rendered multiple times seamlessly.
